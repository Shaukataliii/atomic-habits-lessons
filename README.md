# Lessons from *Atomic Habits* (James Clear)

### 1. The more immediately unsatisfying a behavior is, the less likely it is to occur.
Make the cost of your bad habits high and immediate if you want to break them.

### 2. Make habit contracts to adopt new habits or quit bad ones, just as governments use laws to change behavior.

### 3. The best way to quit a bad habit is to make it painful in the moment. A habit contract is one of the best ways to do so.

### 4. Rules to make a good habit:
- **Make it obvious.**
- **Make it attractive.**
- **Make it easy.**
- **Make it satisfying.**

### 5. Your genes define your area of opportunity.
The odds you have because of your genes define your potential success. For example, if you have a relatively strong mind compared to your physique, then your opportunity lies in areas requiring mental strength rather than physical, and vice versa.

### 6. Natural traits like being an introvert or extrovert are examples of how your genes define your area of opportunity.

### 7. The marks of whether you are made for a task are not defined by whether you like it, but by whether you can handle the pain of that task easier than most people.

### 8. Your task is what makes you lose track of time.

### 9. Your task is the one where you get better results than the average person, putting in the same effort.

### 10. If you canâ€™t find a single quality that gives you exceptional results, look for a combination.

### 11. When you can't win by being better, win by being different.

### 12. Our genes don't eliminate the need for hard work, they clarify it.TQDFXC

### 13. Genes can't make you successful, if you're not putting in the effort.

### 14. Pick the right habit and life is easy, pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle.

### 15. One of the best ways to keep up with a good habit is: Never miss it twice.

### 16. One of the tips to stick to habits for a long time is to do a task (habit) with manageable difficulty.
