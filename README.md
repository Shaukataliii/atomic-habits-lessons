# Lessons from the Atomic Habits book (James Clear)

### 1- The more immediately unsatisfying a behaviour is, the less likely it is to occur.
Make the cost of your bad habits high and immediate, if you want to leave them.

### 2- Make habit contracts to adopt new or leave bad ones, just as Government uses laws to change people behaviours.

### 3- The best way to leave a bad habit is to make it painful in the moment. A habit contract is one of the best ways to do so.

### 4- Rules to make a Good habit:
- Make it obvious.
- Make it attractive.
- Make it easy.
- Make it satisfying.
