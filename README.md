# Lessons from the Atomic Habits book (James Clear)

### 1- The more immediately unsatisfying a behaviour is, the less likely it is to occur.
Make the cost of your bad habits high and immediate, if you want to leave them.

### 2- Make habit contracts to adopt new or leave bad ones, just as Government uses laws to change people behaviours.
